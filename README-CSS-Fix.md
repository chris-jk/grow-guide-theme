# CSS Navigation Fix Summary

## Problem Resolved

The WordPress theme had CSS selectors that were too broad and were affecting other elements throughout the website when WordPress backend-generated menus were used.

## Solution Applied

Added `.site-header` specificity to all navigation-related CSS selectors to ensure they only target the main header navigation and don't interfere with other page elements.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Navigation Selectors

- Updated `.main-navigation` selectors to `.site-header .main-navigation`
- Updated `.nav-menu` selectors to `.site-header .nav-menu`
- Updated `.menu-item` selectors to `.site-header .nav-menu .menu-item`

### 2. Mobile Navigation Selectors

- Updated `.mobile-menu-toggle` to `.site-header .mobile-menu-toggle`
- Updated `.nav-menu-wrapper` to `.site-header .nav-menu-wrapper`
- Updated `.hamburger-line` to `.site-header .hamburger-line`

### 3. Accessibility & Focus Selectors

- Updated focus styles to include `.site-header` scoping
- Updated high contrast mode styles
- Updated reduced motion preferences

### 4. Responsive Design Selectors

- Updated tablet navigation adjustments
- Updated mobile touch targets
- Updated submenu styles

## Files Modified

- `/Users/chris/Desktop/grow-guide-theme/style.css` - Added proper CSS scoping

## Test Files Created

- `/Users/chris/Desktop/grow-guide-theme/css-fix-test.html` - Comprehensive test page

## Expected Results

✅ Header navigation works perfectly with scoped styles
✅ Regular lists maintain default styling (bullet points, etc.)
✅ Custom navigation menus outside header use their own styles
✅ WordPress menu classes outside header don't inherit header styles
✅ Mobile navigation functionality preserved
✅ Accessibility features maintained

## Verification

The fix ensures that:

1. Navigation CSS only affects elements within `.site-header`
2. Other page elements with similar class names are unaffected
3. WordPress backend-generated menus won't break page styling
4. All existing functionality is preserved

## Next Steps

1. Test the theme in a WordPress environment
2. Verify mobile navigation works correctly
3. Check that all accessibility features function properly
4. Ensure the Learn page template works as expected

This fix resolves the critical CSS specificity issue while maintaining all the modern navigation features and accessibility improvements.
